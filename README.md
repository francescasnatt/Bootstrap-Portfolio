# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This project is my online web design portfolio.

## Description

This project highlights deployed applications I have worked on for past clients and the benefits of hiring me.

I was motivated to create this portfolio as I wanted to be able to display my work in a visually appealing and organised way. It also allows prospective employers to easily get in contact with me if they so wish. One thing I learned during the process was how to check my code throughout and keep it as dry as possible.
